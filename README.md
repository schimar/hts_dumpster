# hts_dumpster


This repo contains a mix of different scripts, mostly ```bash```, but likely some ```python``` as well as ```R```, for different purposes. Most of these scripts will be hard-coded to a very specific purpose. However, some of this might be useful to others, so feel free to do some dumpster-diving in here.
